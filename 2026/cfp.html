            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The 1st ACNS Workshop on Intelligent and Secure Computing (ACNS-ISC 2026) provides a premier international forum for researchers, practitioners, and industry experts to present and discuss the latest advances at the intersection of intelligent computing and secure computing. Held in conjunction with ACNS 2026, the workshop aims to promote interdisciplinary collaboration across the fields of artificial intelligence, cryptography, data analytics, and cybersecurity.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                We welcome high-quality contributions that address theoretical foundations, algorithms, architectures, 
                and real-world applications enhancing both intelligence (e.g., AI, ML, data analytics) and security 
                (e.g., privacy, robustness, trustworthiness). Topics include but are not limited to:
